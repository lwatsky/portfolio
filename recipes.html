                <img src="images/brussels.jpg" alt="brussel sprouts"/>
                <p><br>To start, I buy shredded brussel sprouts (from Trader Joe’s) or you can buy them whole and shred them yourself. Put them in a bowl, with 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil to coat the brussel sprouts. Add garlic salt, pepper, and garlic powder (as much as you like), put on a baking sheet with parchment paper and cook in the oven at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes. Top with grated parmesan cheese and balsamic glaze, and enjoy!</p>

                <img src="images/potatoes.JPG" alt="potatoes"/>
                <p><br>I typically buy fingerling potatoes, and to start I cut them in half. I set the air fryer to 380 degrees and allow it to heat up for a few minutes before putting in the potatoes. In the meantime, coat the potatoes in olive oil (about 2 tablespoons) and garlic powder, salt, and pepper (to taste). Mix them around to ensure they are all coated. Put in the air fryer for about 8-10 minutes, then shake the basket to mix around the potatoes, and finally cook for another 8-10 minutes. Serve with whatever condiments you like, and enjoy!</p>

            <div class="eggplant-image">
                <img src="images/eggplant.JPG" alt="eggplant"/>
                <p><br>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Wash and skin the eggplant, then slice into quarter inch rounds. Sprinkle both sides with salt and leave in a strainer with paper towel underneath. Sweating the eggplant takes away the bitterness (leave it for an hour ish). Pay dry to absorb the water and make three bowls (one with flour, one with two eggs, and one with breadcrumbs). Dip both sides in each of the bowls starting with flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs. Bake on a baking sheet with parchment paper for 10 minutes, then flip over and sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top. Bake for another 5-10 minutes. Serve with marinara or your favorite sauce, and enjoy!</p>

                <img src="images/tuna.jpg" alt="spicy tuna"/>
                <p><br>Cook one cup of sushi rice (using the directions on the box) and allow to cool in the fridge. In a mixing bowl, mix together ¼ cup of mayo, 1-2 tablespoons of sriracha, 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, 1 teaspoon of chili oil, and 1 tablespoon of chives. Dice the ahi tuna, and add to the bowl of spicy mayo (allow to sit in the fridge for at least a half hour). Pour 1-2 tablespoons of sesame oil into a pan and put the rice in the pan and mix around until desired crispiness. Place in a bowl, top with the spicy ahi tuna and vegetables of choice, and enjoy!</p>
